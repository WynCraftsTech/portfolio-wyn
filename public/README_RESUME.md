# Resume PDF Setup

## How to add your resume:

1. **Place your resume PDF file** in this folder (`my-app/public/`)
2. **Name it exactly**: `Job_Resume_Aquino.pdf`
3. **File structure should be**:
   ```
   my-app/
   ├── public/
   │   ├── Job_Resume_Aquino.pdf  ← Your resume goes here
   │   ├── index.html
   │   └── ...
   ```

## What happens:
- When users click "Download Resume" buttons, they will download your `Job_Resume_Aquino.pdf` file
- The file will be downloaded as "Job_Resume_Aquino.pdf"

## Notes:
- Make sure your PDF file is named exactly `Job_Resume_Aquino.pdf`
- The file should be in the `public` folder for it to be accessible
- You can replace this README file with your actual resume PDF
